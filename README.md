# pibase-lean

This aims to formalise the properties and theorems from the [π-Base](https://topology.pi-base.org/) in Lean 4.
A motivation for this is found [here](https://felixpernegger.com/mathematics/mathlib-good-first-issue-and-formalisation-of-general-topology/).

Any property and theorem should have abbreviations, see property P37 and theorem T39 as examples.

Many definitions not yet implemented properly are found in the file OldProperties.lean.

To contribute please open an issue and then a PR. Note we are strictly using the definitions from pi-base and *not* mathlib in cases they differ.

As of writing, this project is still in its infancy, so the structure of the repo etc. might and probably will change later.
